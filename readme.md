Here is the comprehensive README.md for your GitHub repository. It is written in the professional, industrial tone of the SC EXPLORER system and includes the technical setup instructions required to get the v1.0.5 engine running.



🛰️ SC EXPLORER (SCE) | Secure Archive v1.0.5

SC EXPLORER is a high-fidelity, terminal-driven asset management system designed for the secure archiving and reconstitution of .c source files. It features a "Dual-Sync" cloud architecture, an integrated AI telemetry engine (NoA), and a hidden Administrator Bridge for manual asset recovery.



🏗️ System Architecture

The system operates on a "Warm Storage" principle. Assets are initially uploaded to a secure Vault (Backup) layer. They can only be moved to the Active Repository through a cryptographic handshake authorized by an Administrator.
